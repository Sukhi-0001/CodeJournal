# **CodeJournal**

Welcome to **CodeJournal** ‚Äî my personal coding journal. This repository is dedicated to solving competitive programming problems, mastering data structures and algorithms (DSA), and documenting my progress along the way.

---

## üìö **Contents**

- **Competitive Programming (CP)**: Problems and solutions from various coding platforms like Codeforces, LeetCode, and others.
- **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**: A collection of algorithmic problems and solutions to help build a strong foundation.
- **Personal Notes**: Reflections, problem-solving approaches, and key insights gained during practice.
- **Practice Problems**: Ongoing problems to continue improving and testing my skills.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

To view and follow along with my practice, clone this repository:

### **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sukhi-0001/CodeJournal.git
```

### **Navigate to the Directory**

```bash
cd CodeJournal
```

### **Start Practicing**

Each problem and solution is organized in individual directories, with explanations, code, and personal reflections.

## üß† **My Approach**

For each problem I solve, I follow a simple process:

1. **Understand** the problem thoroughly by reading the statement and constraints.
2. **Plan** the solution ‚Äî think about time and space complexity.
3. **Implement** the code and test with multiple test cases.
4. **Reflect** on the solution and optimize if needed.
5. **Document** my insights and learnings for future reference.
